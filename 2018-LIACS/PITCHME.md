### What is bioinformatics?

- Very broad definition
- Often used interchangably with *computational biology*
- **Computational biology** = the study of biology using computational techniques.  The goal is to learn new biology, knowledge about living sytems. It is about science.
- **Bioinformatics** = the creation of tools (algorithms, databases) that solve problems. The goal is to build useful tools that work on biological data. It is about engineering.
- In practice: most people do a bit of both.

Note:
- Different definitions based on who you ask
- *Systems biology*, *quantitative biology*


The world of quantitative biology is large, diffuse and sometimes overwhelming. It’s hard sometimes to even figure out what someone means when they say “bioinformatics”. This can make it hard to figure out what part of the field someone works in.

One way to break it down is to describe bioinformatics as the building of tools and methods for the processing and management of biological data, and computational biology as the pursuit of biological sciences using computational methods. Therefore, bioinformatics is more of an engineering discipline and computational biology more a scientific discipline.

It’s helpful to think about these distinctions, subtle as they seem. It takes a certain mindset and skillset to build a robust sequencing analysis pipeline that will serve the needs of a large group of scientists for years. That mindset and skillset may be very different from the one required to do a deep investigation of the variants that impact risk of heart disease.

We can argue about the naming conventions all we want, but the label we apply to these two types of specialist doesn’t really matter. What matters is what they do; the person I would call a computational biologist writes code, yes, but does it in pursuit of a particular biological problem, and they would love to write less code and more manuscripts. The bioinformatician, on the other hand, wants to spend their time writing robust, high-quality code that does interesting and powerful computations. Papers are more of a nice side-effect.

The truth of the matter is that most programming biologists are a mix of the two disciplines.

I spent the first 15 years of my professional life unwilling to recognize a difference between bioinformatics and computational biology.  It was not because I didn’t think that there was or could be a difference, but because I thought the difference was not significant.  I have changed my position on this.  I now believe that they are quite different and worth distinguishing.  For me,

Computational biology = the study of biology using computational techniques.  The goal is to learn new biology, knowledge about living sytems.  It is about science.

Bioinformatics = the creation of tools (algorithms, databases) that solve problems.  The goal is to build useful tools that work on biological data.  It is about engineering.

All this became important to me when I finally joined a bioengineering department, and I was forced to ask myself if I was a scientist or an engineer.  I am both, and now am at peace.

When I build a method (usually as software, and with my staff, students, post-docs–I never unfortunately do it myself anymore), I am engaging in an engineering activity:  I design it to have certain performance characteristics, I build it using best engineering practices, I validate that it performs as I intended, and I create it to solve not just a single problem, but a class of similar problems that all should be solvable with the software.   I then write papers about the method, and these are engineering papers.   This is bioinformatics.

When I use my method (or those of others) to answer a biological question, I am doing science.  I am learning new biology.   The criteria for success has little to do with the computational tools that I use, and is all about whether the new biology is true and has been validated appropriately and to the standards of evidence expected among the biological community.   The papers that result report new biological knowledge and are science papers.  This is computational biology.

As I look at my published work I have always tried to balance the publications in biological/medical journals and those in engineering/informatics journals.  It is an aesthetic really, there is no reason why one should feel compelled to do this.  However, it is useful to know when you are doing biology and when you are doing something else.   I suppose someone can argue with the my use of the term “bioinformatics” as an engineering discipline.  That’s fine–I’m open to a different term.  But I would ask why bioinformatics isn’t good.   I think computational biology is more solid–the ‘biology’ is clearly the noun and the ‘computational’ is clearly the adjective.

### Why Bioinformatics

Note:
And this seems like an understatement, as we are discovering more and more complexity
