### What is bioinformatics?

+++

### What is bioinformatics?

*The use of computer science, mathematics, and information theory to model and analyze biological systems, especially systems involving genetic material.*

![](assets/images/bioinformatics/venn.png)

+++
### What is bioinformatics

- **Data analysis.** Going from raw data, to clean data, to statistical and visual interpretations of the results
- **Software development.** Developing software to do bioinformatics analysis, big enough software products to publish as independent methods papers and to be used by other scientists.
- **Modeling.** simulations, and writing equations to represent biological systems.

+++
### What is bioinformatics?

Many different areas of research
- Healthcare
- Ecology
- Agriculture
- Evolutionary Development
- ..

### What is bioinformatics?

- Very broad definition
- Often used interchangably with *computational biology*
- **Computational biology** = the study of biology using computational techniques.  The goal is to learn new biology, knowledge about living sytems. It is about science.
- **Bioinformatics** = the creation of tools (algorithms, databases) that solve problems. The goal is to build useful tools that work on biological data. It is about engineering.
- In practice: most people do a bit of both.

Note:
- Different definitions based on who you ask
- *Systems biology*, *quantitative biology*

### Why Bioinformatics

![scale-70 Biology easily has 500 years of exciting problems to work on" - Donald Knuth](assets/images/cartoons/donald-knuth-quote.jpg)

Note:
Famous computer scientist Donald Knuth has discussed his concerns that computer science in the future will be “pretty much working on refinements of well-explored things”, whereas “Biology easily has 500 years of exciting problems to work on”.

And this seems like an understatement, as we are discovering more and more complexity

+++

### Why Bioinformatics

- Data Analysis
- Software development
- Modelling

Note:

---
### ErasmusMC

+++

### ErasmusMC

- Research Hospital
- Bioinformatics Department
- Support all other departments in their research
- Support outside labs


![scale-50](assets/images/erasmusmc.jpg)

+++

### The Biologist and the Informatician

- Work closely together on any project
- Domain knowledge vs computational knowledge

![scale-50](assets/images/cartoons/experimental-vs-computational.jpeg)

+++

### Biologists

<div class="left70">
<ul>
<li>Not typically trained in programming</li>
<li>Excel is their analysis tool of choice </li>
<li>No longer possible in big data era</li>
</ul>

### Academia vs Industry

Note:
source: https://www.slideshare.net/hafidztio/academia-vs-industry

+++

### Salary

- You will earn more at a company
- Academia offers other advantages: flexibility, freedom

<div class="bottom">
![scale-60](assets/images/academia/academicsalaries.gif)
</div>

Note:
- Industry pays more, but academia has lot of pros too
- Disclaimer: I am biased and never worked in industry


+++

### Flexibility

<div class="left">
<br><br>
**Academia**
<br>
<ul>
<li> Informal, flat hierarchy </li>
<li> Flexible schedule </li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="right">
<br><br>
**Industry**
<br>
<ul>
<li>More structured</li>
<li>Core working hours</li>
</ul>
</div>
<br><br><br><br><br><br>

<div class="bottom">
![scale-80](assets/images/academia/academicdresscode.gif)
</div>

Note:
- I don't have to ask for time off, just take it
- As long as projects stay on track, can make your own hours
- Treated as equal from the start, ideas valued
- YMMV! (and other countries can be very different)

+++

### Flexibility

- But: this flexibililty breeds a lot of workaholics
- Take care to keep a healthy work-life balance!

<br>

<div class="bottom">
![scale-60](assets/images/academia/academicsaturdays.gif)
</div>

Note:
- Make sure to guard your work-life balance

+++

### Freedom

<div class="left">
<br><br>
**Academia**
<br>
<ul>
<li> Freedom to choose projects </li>
<li> Lot of travel </li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="right">
<br><br>
**Industry**
<br>
<ul>
<li>Constrained by needs of company</li>
</ul>
</div>
<br><br><br><br><br><br>


<div class="bottom">
![scale-60](assets/images/academia/academicfreedom.gif)
</div>

Note:
- Great freedom to choose projects
- Within limitation of course
- YMMV as always

+++

### Outputs


<div class="left">
<br><br>

<li> Obtain new knowledge </li>
<li> Publish papers, obtain funding </li>
<li> Train new scientists </li>
</ul>
<br><br>
![scale-60](assets/images/academia/journal-article.jpg)

<li> Software, drugs, patents, services </li>
</ul>
<br><br>

![scale-50](assets/images/academia/pill-head.jpg)

</div>

Note:

- Academia does basic research
- Industry converts knowledge into real-world applications

+++

### Academia **AND** Industry

Often close collaborations between academia and companies

<div class="bottom">
![scale-60](assets/images/academia/collaboration.png)
</div>

Note:
- Especially in larger consortia
- Sometimes a requirement for grant proposals
- Obtain the knowledge and convert it to usable products in one project

+++

### Imposter Syndrome

- Feeling of being a fraud
- "Everybody else knows more than I do"
- Own successes dismissed as luck, not deserved

<div class-"bottom">
![scale-60](assets/images/academia/impostor-syndrome.jpg)
<div>

Note:
- very common
- esp in such a fast evolving field, both CS and bioinf, can never know everything
- remind yourself that this is common
- don't let it stop you

Impostor syndrome is a psychological pattern in which people doubt their accomplishments and have a persistent, often internalized fear of being exposed as a "fraud". The term was coined in 1978 by clinical psychologists Pauline R. Clance and Suzanne A. Imes. Despite external evidence of their competence, those exhibiting the syndrome remain convinced that they are frauds and do not deserve the success they have achieved.

Proof of success is dismissed as luck, timing, or as a result of deceiving others into thinking they are more intelligent and competent than they believe themselves to be. While early research focused on the prevalence among high-achieving women, impostor syndrome has been found to affect both men and women, in roughly equal numbers.
