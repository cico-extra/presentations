### What is bioinformatics?

*The use of computer science, mathematics, and information theory to model and analyze biological systems, especially systems involving genetic material.*

### What is bioinformatics

- **Data analysis.** Going from raw data, to clean data, to statistical and visual interpretations of the results
- **Software development.** Developing software to do bioinformatics analysis, big enough software products to publish as independent methods papers and to be used by other scientists.
- **Modeling.** simulations, and writing equations to represent biological systems.

### What is bioinformatics?

- Very broad definition
- Often used interchangably with *computational biology*
- **Computational biology** = the study of biology using computational techniques.  The goal is to learn new biology, knowledge about living sytems. It is about science.
- **Bioinformatics** = the creation of tools (algorithms, databases) that solve problems. The goal is to build useful tools that work on biological data. It is about engineering.
- In practice: most people do a bit of both.

Note:
- Different definitions based on who you ask
- *Systems biology*, *quantitative biology*

### Why Bioinformatics

![scale-70 Biology easily has 500 years of exciting problems to work on" - Donald Knuth](assets/images/cartoons/donald-knuth-quote.jpg)

Note:
Famous computer scientist Donald Knuth has discussed his concerns that computer science in the future will be “pretty much working on refinements of well-explored things”, whereas “Biology easily has 500 years of exciting problems to work on”.

And this seems like an understatement, as we are discovering more and more complexity

### Why Bioinformatics

- Data Analysis
- Software development
- Modelling

Note:

---

### What I do

- Jackie of all trades
- automation, system administration, pipeline building, infrastructure, training
- define and adopt best practices, make it durable, maintainable
- many classes from BSc/MSc useful
  - programming, databases, data mining, natural computing/algorithmics
+++

write papers
go to conferences
teach workshops
develop pipelines
data analysis

### Biology Refresher

+++

![scale-70](assets/images/bioinformatics/dna.png)

+++

### The Central Dogma


---
### A Brief primer on Genomics

![](assets/images/bioinformatics/whatisbioinf.png)

+++

Central Dogma

genome, chromosomes, genes, proteins, 3d structure (optimization problem)

size of genome?

---

### DNA Sequencing

+++

### Human Genome Project

+++

### Sequencers

small reads, must be mapped back to reference genome (string matching problem)

### Sequence Data Explosion

![scale-70](assets/images/bioinformatics/sequencing_explosion.jpg)

Note:
data explosion, moores law on steroids


---
### Pipelines and Automation

fields like astronomy experience same data explosion, key difference being that astronomers are typically trained in mathematics and programming.

biologists are not.

---
### Pipelines and Automation

![](assets/images/cartoons/excel.png)

Note:
Biologists used to analysing everything in excel

With sequencing this is no longer possible (though it doesn't stop them from trying)

---

### Pipelines and Automation

![](assets/images/cartoons/redbutton.gif)

### Galaxy

### Cancer


---
### Microbiota
